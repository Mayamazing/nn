    <h1>Welcome to my website about Manatees!</h1>
    <p>Manatees are herbivorous, marine mammals. Part of the reason I like manatees is because of their large, marshmallow figure and calm disposition. Manatees are often described as the cows of the sea because of their placid nature.</p>

<figcaption> <b><u> Fun Fact</u></b>: Manatees' closest living land relatives are elephants! </figcaption>
    
    
    <p>Sadly, manatees are threatened because of human activities in the waters which they live. Tragic incidents like boat collisions and entanglement in fishing gear injures these poor creatures and can even kill them. Visit <a class="image_1"  target =" _blank" href="https://savethemanatee.org/how-to-help/support-manatee-protection/">Support Manatees Protection</a> to help keep these adaorable, kind creatures healthy and safe.</p>
